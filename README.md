## Example code accompanying Cusworth et al. (2021)
### "A Bayesian framework for deriving sector-based methane emissions from top-down fluxes"

This script ("PartitionExample.ipynb") can be used to partition Permian Basin fluxes derived from a TROPOMI inversion (Zhang et al., 2020) to unique emission sectors, based on a combination of prior inventories from Scarpelli et al., Maasakkers et al., and Ma et al. The mechanics of the code are based on Equations 1 and 2 from the manuscript.

The code is flexible such that if one wants to change flux and emission inputs, this can be run for a different region.
